# Toy Story 2 Like Game, with SpongeBob Stuff

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).

The files "gameenemy.pas", "gameinitialize.pas", "gameviewplay.pas", should go into a folder called "code" in the main directory, as that is the code of the game so far.

The files "CastleSettings.xml", "gameviewmain.castle-user-interface", and "README.txt" go in the "data" folder.

The rest of the files will go in the data folder as well, with a couple final ones that will just go in the main directory.

The files that end in ".glb" that do not have any presets "InCaps-" like this, on the beginning of the name, will go in the "generalgame-assets" subfolder in the data folder.

The files "upper.md3", "lower.md3", "head.md3", "animation.cfg", "helmet.png", "helmet_red.png", "sandy.png", "sandy_blue.png", and "sandy_red.png" go in the "sandyparts" subfolder in the "generalgame-assets" subfolder.

The files "cannon_puffer.mtl", "cannon_puffer.obj", and "cannon_puffer_jf.png" will go in the "Puffer Fish" subfolder in the "generalgame-assets" subfolder.

The files that end in ".glb" that do indeed have the presets "InCaps-" like this at the beginning of the name will go in the "sandystreedome-assets" subfolder in the data folder.

The files that end in ".png" will go in the "toystoryimages" subfolder in the data subfolder.

The files that end in ".jpg" will go in the "level1_background" subfolder in the "toystoryimages" subfolder.

The files that end in ".wav" and ".mp3" that start with a lowercase character will go in the "toystory-ingamesounds-sandy" subfolder in the data subfolder.

The file "Tomfoolery.ogg" will go in the "toystorymusic" subfolder in the data subfolder.

The files that end in ".wav" that start with an uppercase character will go in the "toystory-soundeffects" subfolder in the data subfolder.

The rest of the files will go in the main directory, and not any sub-folders, unlike the other files.
