# Toy Story 2 Like Game, with SpongeBob Stuff

Using [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/).

The files "gameenemy.pas", "gameinitialize.pas", "gameviewplay.pas", should go into a folder called "code" in the main directory, as that is the code of the game so far.

The files "CastleSettings.xml", "gameviewmain.castle-user-interface", and "README.txt" go in the "data" folder.

The rest of the files will go in the main directory, and not any sub-folders, unlike the other files.
